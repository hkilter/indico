*Unreleased*

Major Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Add event roles, which are similar to local groups but within the
  scope of an event. They can be used both for assigning permissions
  within the event and also for quickly seeing which user has which
  role (such as "Program Committee" in the event

  now shows each person's custom event roles and whether they have
  registered for the event in addition to the the default roles
  (speaker, chairperson, etc.)
- Add visibility options to custom abstract/contribution fields
  so they can be restricted to be editable/visible only for event
  managers or authors/submitters instad of anyone who can see the
  abstract/contribution

  file (:issue:`3144`)

Improvements
